     <i>Born with a daredevil spirit, Kaely never enjoyed sitting still.
     She grew up in Washington, D.C. and was a competitive gymnast her entire life.
     When she was 17, she decided to take a year off before attending one of America's top universities, to join a small circus in Torino, Italy.
     What she thought would be a one year adventure turned into a new found love, and career!</i><br><br> 

     <i>Kaely has now performed across the world, from Paris to Mumbai to New Orleans!
     She has experience with both traditional and contemporary circuses, in theatres, arenas and in tents, with live musicians, and one time even above a full orchestra!</i><br><br>

     <i>On her days of, she spends he time volunteering on ambulances as an Emergency Medical Technician.
     It has been an incredible adventure, and she can't wait to see where it leads her next!</i>
